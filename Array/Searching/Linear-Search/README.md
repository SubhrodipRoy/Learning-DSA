# Linear Search

In this program, we first take an array (or list) as input from the user.

We then perform the following operations:

- **Linear Search:**  
  The program searches for a user-specified element in the array using the **Linear Search** technique. In this method, the array is traversed sequentially from the beginning, and each element is compared with the target element until a match is found or the end of the array is reached.

  If the target element is found, its index is printed. If not, a message indicating that the element is not present in the array is shown.

This logic is implemented in **C**, **Java**, and **Python** in this folder.
