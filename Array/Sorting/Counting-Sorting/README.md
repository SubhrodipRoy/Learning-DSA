# Counting Sort

In this program, we first take an array (or list) as input from the user.

We then perform the following operations:

- **Counting Sort:**  
  The program sorts the array using the **Counting Sort** technique. This algorithm works efficiently for sorting non-negative integers when the range of input values is not significantly larger than the number of elements.

  In **Counting Sort**, we count the occurrences of each unique element using a separate count array. Then, we reconstruct the sorted array by iterating over the count array and placing each element in the correct frequency.

  The programs provided here implement the **Counting Sort** algorithm for **ascending order**. It assumes the input consists only of **non-negative integers**. Counting sort is not comparison-based, and hence differs from traditional sorting techniques like Bubble Sort or Quick Sort.

This logic is implemented in **C**, **Java**, and **Python** in this folder.
