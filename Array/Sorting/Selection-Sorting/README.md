# Selection Sort

In this program, we first take an array (or list) as input from the user.

We then perform the following operations:

- **Selection Sort:**  
  The program sorts the array using the **Selection Sort** technique, where the smallest (or largest) element is repeatedly selected from the unsorted portion of the array and swapped with the first unsorted element. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

  The programs provided here implement the **Selection Sort** algorithm for **ascending order**. In ascending order, the algorithm works by iterating through the unsorted part of the array and selecting the minimum element, which is then swapped with the first unsorted element. The process continues for the rest of the array until all elements are sorted.

  To sort in **descending order**, the comparison condition is reversed: instead of selecting the minimum element, we select the maximum element from the unsorted portion and swap it with the first unsorted element.

This logic is implemented in **C**, **Java**, and **Python** in this folder.
