# Bubble Sort

In this program, we first take an array (or list) as input from the user.

We then perform the following operations:

- **Bubble Sort:**  
  The program sorts the array using the **Bubble Sort** technique, where adjacent elements are repeatedly compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

  The programs provided here implement the **Bubble Sort** algorithm for **ascending order**. In ascending order, the elements are compared in pairs, and if the current element is greater than the next one, they are swapped. The process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating the array is sorted.

  To sort in **descending order**, the comparison condition is reversed: instead of checking if the current element is greater than the next one, we check if the current element is **less** than the next one, and swap if true.

This logic is implemented in **C**, **Java**, and **Python** in this folder.
