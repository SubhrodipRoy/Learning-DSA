# Insertion Sort

In this program, we first take an array (or list) as input from the user.

We then perform the following operations:

- **Insertion Sort:**  
  The program sorts the array using the **Insertion Sort** technique. In this method, elements are picked one by one from the unsorted part of the array and inserted into their correct position in the sorted part of the array.

  The programs provided here implement the **Insertion Sort** algorithm for **ascending order**. In ascending order, each new element is compared with the elements before it, and shifted until it reaches a position where the order is maintained.

  To sort in **descending order**, the comparison condition is reversed: instead of checking if the current element is smaller than the previous elements, we check if it is **greater**, and shift accordingly.

This logic is implemented in **C**, **Java**, and **Python** in this folder.
