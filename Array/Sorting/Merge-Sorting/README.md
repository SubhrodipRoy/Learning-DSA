# Merge Sort

In this program, we first take an array (or list) as input from the user.

We then perform the following operations:

- **Merge Sort:**  
  The program sorts the array using the **Merge Sort** technique. This is a classic divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively splits the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together.

  The programs provided here implement the **Merge Sort** algorithm for **ascending order**. During merging, two sorted subarrays are compared element by element, and the smaller of the two is copied into the main array.

  To sort in **descending order**, the comparison condition during merging is reversed: instead of comparing which element is smaller, we compare which is **greater** and merge accordingly.

This logic is implemented in **C**, **Java**, and **Python** in this folder.
