# Quick Sort

In this program, we first take an array (or list) as input from the user.

We then perform the following operations:

- **Quick Sort:**  
  The program sorts the array using the **Quick Sort** technique. Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element from the array and partitions the array into two sub-arrays: one with elements smaller than the pivot and the other with elements greater than the pivot. These sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

  The programs provided here implement the **Quick Sort** algorithm for **ascending order**. In ascending order, the algorithm works by choosing a pivot element, placing it in the correct position, and then recursively sorting the left and right sub-arrays.

  To sort in **descending order**, the comparison condition is reversed: instead of checking if the current element is less than or equal to the pivot, we check if it is **greater** than the pivot during partitioning, and recursively sort accordingly.

This logic is implemented in **C**, **Java**, and **Python** in this folder.
