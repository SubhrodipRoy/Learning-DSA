# Array Element Deletion

In this program, we first take an array (or list) as input from the user.

We then perform the following operations:

- **Element Deletion:**  
  The user specifies the index of the element to delete. We validate the index, then remove the element at that position by shifting the remaining elements (in C and Java) or using built-in methods (in Python).

This logic is implemented in **C**, **Java**, and **Python** in this folder.
