# Array Traversal

In this program, we first take an array as input from the user.

We then perform two types of traversal:

- **Forward Traversal:**  
  We use a loop that starts from index `0` and goes up to `size - 1` to print the elements in the original order.

- **Reverse Traversal:**  
  We use a loop that starts from index `size - 1` and goes down to `0` to print the elements in reverse order.

This logic is implemented in **Java**, **C**, and **Python** in this folder.
