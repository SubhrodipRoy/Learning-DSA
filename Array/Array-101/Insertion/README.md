# Array Element Insertion

In this program, we first take an array as input from the user.

We then perform the following operations:

- **Element Insertion:**  
  The user specifies the element to insert and the index at which to insert it. We then shift the elements in the array (or list) to the right, if necessary, and insert the new element at the specified index.

This logic is implemented in **C**, **Java**, and **Python** in this folder.
